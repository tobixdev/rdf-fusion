# RdfFusion

RdfFusion is a graph database implementing the [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/) standard.

The query engine of RdfFusion is based on the [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) columnar format and
[Apache DataFusion](https://datafusion.apache.org/), an extensible query engine based on Arrow. 

## Getting Started

You can use `cargo` to interact with the codebase or use [Just](https://github.com/casey/just) to run the pre-defined
commands, also used for continuous integration builds.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/tobixdev/graphfusion.git # Clone Repository
git submodule update --init # Initialize submodules
just check # Run checks 
```

## Acknowledgements

The project started as a fork from [Oxigraph](https://github.com/oxigraph/oxigraph), a graph database written in Rust
with a custom SPARQL query engine.
While large portions of the codebase have been written from scratch, there is still code from Oxigraph in this
repository.
RdfFusion would not exist without Oxigraph.
